NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::AutoVersion::Relative - Time-Relative versioning

VERSION
    version 0.01010003

SYNOPSIS
    Like all things, time is relative. This plugin is to allow you to
    auto-increment versions based on a relative time point.

    It doesn't do it all for you, you can choose, its mostly like
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::AutoVersion except there's a few more user-visible
    entities, and a few more visible options.

CONFIGURATION
    To configure this, you specify the date that the version is to be
    relative to.

  Serving Suggestion
      [AutoVersion::Relative]
      major = 1
      minor = 1
      year  = 2009 ;  when we did our last major rev
      month = 08   ;   "           "
      day   = 23   ;   "           "
      hour  = 05   ;   "           "
      minute = 30  ;   "           "
      second = 00  ;  If you're that picky.

      time_zone = Pacific/Auckland  ;  You really want to set this.

       ; 1.0110012
      format = {{$major}}.{{sprintf('%02d%04d%02d', $minor, days, hours }}

    For the list of tuneables and how to use them, see "ATTRIBUTES" and
    "DATE ATTRIBUTES"

FORMATTING
    There are a handful of things we inject into the template for you

      # Just to give you an idea, you don't really want to be using this though.
      {{ $major }}.{{ $minor }}{{ days }}{{ hours }}{{ $relative->seconds }}

    See "FORMAT FIELDS" for the available fields and their use.

WARNING
    If you don't specify Y/M/D, it will default to Jan 01, 2000 , because I
    couldn't think of a more sane default. But you're setting that anyway,
    because if you don't,you be cargo cultin' the bad way

ATTRIBUTES
  major
  major = 1
  minor
  minor = 1
  format
  format = {{ sprintf('%d.%02d%04d%02d', $major, $minor, days, hours) }}
    See "FORMATING"

DATE ATTRIBUTES
  year
  year = 2000
  month
  month = 1
  day
  day = 1
  minute
  minute = 0
  second
  second = 0
  time_zone
    You want this.

    Either Olson Format ( Olson::Abbreviations ), "Pacific/Auckland" , or
    merely "+1200" format.

FORMAT FIELDS
  $major
    The value set for major

  $minor
    The value set for minor

  $relative
    A DateTime::Duration object

  cldr
  cldr($ARG)
    CLDR for the current time. See "format_cldr" in DateTime

  days
    An approximation of the number of days passed since milestone.

    Note that for this approximation, it is assumed all months are 31 days
    long, and years as such, have 372 days.

    This is purely to make sure numbers don't slip backwards, as its
    currently too hard to work out the exact number of days passed. Fixes
    welcome if you want this to respond properly.

  hours
    The remainder number of hours elapsed.

METHODS
  provide_version
    returns the formatted version string to satisfy the roles.
